Louis: coder, result
Pace: parler de combiner sgd et ALS. Parler plus de 180 features. Que grid search prend trop de temps.
Chris : methodology + tester avec 180

FINDING GAMMA AND FINDING WEIGHTE AVERAGE (ask Chris about implementation)


















Find good lambdas (chris et Louis)
Find good values of K (maybe 20 features is too low for 10K movies) (chris et louis)
changer min_number_features (pace)
use item_features instead of full_item_features in fill added ellements (et dans l'autre sens) (marche pas pour train)
lancer fill_added_user pls fois (pace) (has no impact)
reflechir sur quoi mettre dans add_remove_elements (mean ?)
mettre sur master (pace)
Look at the litterature on the internet (pace)

Create a submission function
Try to normalize the data
Try other initial conditions


randomize data or sort by number of ratings ?
Try the threshold modification (threhsold should be close to the number of features so that a user with only one rating doesn't get all its features to smth crazy)
new line in output



remove item and users < threshold in train and test but know which indices you removed. DONE
insert in item_features, and user_features the removed items and users with features calculated with the allready in place features.DONE
Recalculate the inserted items/users's features with one iteration of the for in update_user_feature and update_item_features. DONE
Put methods in project DONE
Find errors in ALS in ex10baligand and ex10Chris DONE
